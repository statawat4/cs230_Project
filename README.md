Original Champsim folder contains workable files for Non-Inclusive hierarchy.
It also contains the 4 replacement policies fifo, lfu, lru & random in replacement subfolder.


#### plot folder 
Contains graphs showing comparison between different traces.
For each trace we've plotted 6 graphs, collectively showing differences using the paramneters IPC and DRAM Access(%) between Inclusive, Non Inclusive and Exclusive hierarchy combined with different replacement policies like fifo, lfu, lru & random. Along the X-axis, plotted against the different cache sizes mainly (MB) 8, 16, 32 & 64.

#### Running Instruction
